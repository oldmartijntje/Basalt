                                    This web app was born out of necessity. When I stopped using a smartphone, I
                                    encountered
                                    a problem:
                                    how to continue tracking my board game statistics? The excellent
                                    <a href="https://www.bgstatsapp.com/" target="_blank">Board Game Stats mobile
                                        app</a>
                                    allows you to export plays, which you can import here, and vice versa.
                                </p>

                                    nor is it monetized in any way. If you're a mobile user, I highly recommend trying
                                    their excellent app first. This alternative is specifically designed for those who
                                    prefer
                                    a desktop or web-based solution.
